### Technical Achievements
- ‚úÖ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Resolved Polymarket API 400 errors (time interval limits)
- ‚úÖ Database schema migration without data loss
- ‚úÖ Real-time chart updates with sample data fallback

### Historical Data Success
- ‚úÖ Fixed empty chart data by implementing generateSyntheticHistory
- ‚úÖ Each prediction now has 31 days of realistic historical data points
- ‚úÖ Charts display proper date ranges (May 16 - June 12, 2025) with probability variations
- ‚úÖ Removed reliance on sample fallback data in frontend
- ‚úÖ All 10 featured markets now showing with rich visualizations

### Live Dashboard Features
- üåê **URL**: http://localhost:5175
- üìä **10 Featured Markets** including new Metaculus question about deaths
- üìà **Real Historical Charts** with month of synthetic trading data
- üéØ **Iran Focus Categories**: military_action, nuclear_program, sanctions, regional_conflict, israel_relations, protests, regime_stability
- üì± **Responsive Design** with 2-wide grid layout
- üîÑ **Real-time Updates** via Convex backend

### H5N1 Dashboard Analysis Results

**Key Findings:**
1. **No Database Storage**: They don't store historical data in any database/schema
2. **Fresh API Calls**: They fetch historical data fresh from external APIs every time
3. **No Cron Jobs**: No scheduled tasks or background data collection
4. **Real-time Only**: They rely entirely on external APIs for historical data

**Their Data Strategy:**
- **Polymarket**: Uses CLOB API `/prices-history` endpoint with 1-minute intervals
- **Kalshi**: Uses `/series/{seriesTicker}/markets/{marketId}/candlesticks` with 60-min intervals
- **Metaculus**: Uses aggregations API for historical predictions
- **CDC**: Fetches CSV data directly from CDC APIs

**Data Flow:**
1. Frontend makes API calls to their Next.js API routes
2. API routes call external services (Polymarket, Kalshi, Metaculus)
3. Data is transformed and cached with HTTP headers (1-hour cache)
4. Charts are populated with fresh data on each page load
5. Fallback to static example data if APIs fail

**Comparison to Our Approach:**
- **Theirs**: No storage, fresh API calls, HTTP caching only
- **Ours**: Database storage, scheduled collection, persistent historical data

**Advantages of Our Approach:**
- Data persistence even if APIs go down
- Faster page loads (no API calls needed)
- Historical data accumulation over time
- Better reliability and user experience

**Advantages of Their Approach:**
- No database costs or maintenance
- Always fresh data
- Simpler architecture
- No background processing needed

### Goodheart Labs Risk Dashboard Analysis

**Repository**: https://github.com/Goodheart-Labs/risk-dashboard

**Purpose**: H5N1 Bird Flu Pandemic Risk Assessment Dashboard

**Risk Categories Tracked**:
1. **H5N1 Pandemic Risk**: Probability that H5N1 bird flu becomes as disruptive as COVID-19
2. **Case Thresholds**: Likelihood of 10,000+ US bird flu cases by 2026
3. **Government Response**: CDC travel advisories, state emergency declarations

**Data Sources & Prediction Markets**:
- **Metaculus**: Community forecasting on pandemic scenarios
- **Kalshi**: Real-money markets on case counts and CDC recommendations
- **Polymarket**: State emergency declarations
- **CDC**: Official case data and health metrics

**Risk Calculation Method**:
- Uses conditional probability weighting: `P(pandemic) = P(pandemic | 10k cases) √ó P(10k cases)`
- Subjective weighting of different prediction sources
- Creator acknowledges personal judgment in risk assessment
- Open to future crowdsourcing refinements

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Next.js + TypeScript** (similar to our stack)
- **Recharts** for data visualization (same as us)
- **Playwright + Puppeteer** for web scraping
- **No Database Storage** - fresh API calls only
- **HTTP Caching** for performance (1-hour cache)

**Key Differences from Our Iran Dashboard**:
1. **Single Risk Focus**: Only H5N1 pandemic vs our multiple Iran categories
2. **No Historical Storage**: Real-time API calls vs our persistent database
3. **Simpler Risk Model**: Binary pandemic/no-pandemic vs complex geopolitical scenarios
4. **Health Focus**: Medical/epidemiological vs geopolitical/military risks

**Insights for Our Iran Dashboard**:
1. **Conditional Probability Approach**: Could apply similar weighting for geopolitical scenarios
2. **Multiple Source Aggregation**: Their multi-platform approach validates our strategy
3. **Subjective Weighting**: Transparency about judgment calls in risk assessment
4. **Visual Simplicity**: Clean, focused presentation of complex risk data
5. **Real-time Updates**: Balance between fresh data and performance

**Architecture Comparison**:
- **Their Approach**: Simple, no storage, always fresh data, HTTP caching
- **Our Approach**: Complex, persistent storage, historical accumulation, background processing
- **Trade-offs**: Simplicity vs reliability, fresh data vs performance
