## Key Insight

The rollback was worth it because:
1. We eliminated circular dependencies
2. We have a working foundation
3. We can add features incrementally
4. Each feature can be tested in isolation
5. The codebase is much simpler to understand

The main loss was the beautiful historical charts and the advanced admin features, but these can be added back one by one without the complexity that was causing issues.
